#
# NixOS backend for the client catalogue. Here the system IS nix, so installing the clients into
# `environment.systemPackages` is correct rather than a duplication of a distro package manager.
#
# THE CLUSTER SIDE IS NOT HERE AND WILL NOT BE. `nixnotes.streams` / `nixnotes.notebooks` /
# `nixnotes.archives` / `nixnotes.renderers` render Kubernetes objects through a nixidy evaluation,
# which is a different module system with a different set of options; a NixOS host composing this
# file gets the client surface and nothing else. That is the boundary rather than a gap -- see
# ./cluster.nix.
#
# EVERY ATTRIBUTE IS FORCE-EVALUATED, not merely looked up, and the reason is measured rather than
# theoretical: nixpkgs converts a renamed package into `<oldName> = throw "renamed to ...";`, which
# keeps the key present and only fails when the value is forced -- which is exactly what building
# `environment.systemPackages` does. So an existence check here would ship a host configuration
# that evaluates and then fails to build. `tryEval` turns a stale mapping into a skip plus a
# warning instead of taking the whole system evaluation down: ../lib/clients.nix is a data table,
# and one stale row in it should not be able to make a machine unbuildable.
#
# A `null` ATTRIBUTE IS NOT A STALE ROW, and the two are reported separately on purpose. Null means
# the catalogue KNOWS there is no nixpkgs derivation -- verified and recorded -- so the honest thing
# on this platform is to say the selection cannot be satisfied here. A stale row means the
# catalogue believed there was one and there is not, which is a bug in the catalogue. Collapsing
# them into one message would send somebody to fix a file that is correct.
#
# NOTHING IS CATALOGUED YET, so this backend installs nothing on every host that composes it. It
# exists ahead of the first entry because the alternative is writing it under time pressure on the
# day somebody assigns one -- and because a plane whose backends do not exist is a plane nobody can
# evaluate the cost of using.
